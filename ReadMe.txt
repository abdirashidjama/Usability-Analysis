Descriptive Statistic 

Purpose: Compared the usability of the two schemes one using image logins and the other a traditional text login scheme. This was done by calculating descriptive statistics and producing graphs. The raw data came in two files named imagept21.csv and text21.csv which had to be combed through and data specific to failed and successful login times were extracted and calculated. Password schemes can be viewed at https://mvp.soft.carleton.ca/svp3008.

Files:
3008.py : the actual program that generates the csv files and outputs descriptive data
Final.csv : contains username their number and average time for successful and failed logins aswell as what scheme they were testing.
Combined.csv : a file containing the exact same lines from text21.csv and imagept21.csv combined.
